This is a brief outline of the steps required to get the development environment of Potion Store up
and running on your local machine.

- Edit the following config files to suit your needs

  - config/store.yml
  - config/paypal_wps.yml

- Create config/google_checkout.yml. Modify it with your credentials.
  ```
  # Settings for Google Checkout
  # Get these by logging into Google Checkout's merchant site and the sandbox equivalent

  development:

- Set session store secret
  - Edit config/secrets.yml
  - run ```rake secret``` to generate secret_key_base's

- Setup database
  - Install Postgresql or MySQL if you haven't
  - Create the store_development database.
  	Make sure to set the encoding of the database to UTF8.
	I recommend pgAdmin for Postgresql newcomers.
  - Edit config/database.yml
  - run ```rake db:create db:migrate``` to create the database schema
  
- Precompile Assets
  - run ```rake assets:clobber``` to clean any previously cached assets
  - run ```rake assets:precompile```
   
- Run ```rails s``` and test through
  <http://localhost:3000/store> and
  <http://localhost:3000/store/admin>

- Replace the default license key generator in lib/licensekey.rb with your own

- If you are setting up Google Checkout, log into your Google Checkout account (sandbox or live), go
  to Settings->Integration and put in your URL that corresponds to the following:

  https://secure.potionfactory.com/store/notification/gcheckout

  That is the URL that Google uses to make callbacks. If you don't set this up, your customers will
  not get their orders delivered by email.


Debugging
---------

1. ```gem install ruby-debug```
2. Put 'debugger' where you want to break in your source code
3. Start the app with ```rails s --debugger``` to enable breakpoints

  
Final Notes
